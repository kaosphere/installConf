===========

installConf Psycko

This conf installs the bash ctafconf (see ctaf42 on github), zsh, git, and some software for a new empty system. 

Run firts install conf, and then gitconf.

You must paste the created public key in your distant git server (github, gitorious... ) to finish configuration.

With github you can verify the good work of the script by using : 

ssh -T git@github.com
